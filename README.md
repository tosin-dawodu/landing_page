## Summary of Project
This project reflects the use of basic javascript manipulation for the DOM. As the second project in the **Frontend web developer** course on **Udacity**, this project illustrates how to;

- Dynamically build the nav using `append`, `appendChild` etc.
- Make the nav items active based on the section that is being viewed.
- Link nav items to sections in the body.
- Use event listeners for click events and so on.
